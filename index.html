            <li><u>Youth/Family Hockey</u></li>
            <p>Fun for the whole family!! All ages are invited to play. Played on foot(sneakers) and with a ball, it's the perfect opportunity for begginers to get a stick in their hand and experience how fun hockey is. The only equipment needed are sneakers(close toed shoes), we have plenty of sticks to use but feel free to bring your own if you'd like.</p>
            <li><u>Adult Inline Hockey</u></li>
            <p>Fast paced pick-up hockey. Minimal experience skating is encouraged since it's a faster pace but if you're looking to learn we're more than happy to teach you. Required equipment are skates, stick, gloves, helmet, and shin pads. We have all equipment for you to use except for skates. This is a great game for begginers looking to get more involved in fast paced hockey or experienced players trying to hone thier skills.</p>
            <li><u>Pick-up Foot Hockey</u></li>
            <p>A good median between Youth/Family hockey and Adult Inline. Fast paced and tons of fun, the only equipment you need are shoes, a stick, and gloves(not required but they help). Again, we have extra equipment for you to use</p>
